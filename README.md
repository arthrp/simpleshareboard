Virtual whiteboard for multiple users. Share your writings/drawings/etc in real time with other people. Currently a very simple PoC with several limitations:
* Only one user can draw on board at the same time
* No Auth

## Building and running
If you have .NET Core 3 SDK, you're good to go. Just type ```dotnet run``` and open your favourite browser.
